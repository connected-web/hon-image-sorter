# HON Image Sorter

Hot or not, image sorter - a locally hosted web interface for sorting through and classifying large numbers of images generated by stable difussion type tools.

## Setup

Prerequisites:

- NodeJS LTS (> 18)

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/connected-web/hon-image-sorter.git
```

Install dependencies:

```
cd hon-image-sorter
npm install
```

Modify the `HON_IMAGE_PATH` in `package.json` - default is currently `HON_IMAGE_PATH=/home/markavian/ComfyUI/output`

Start the server, run:

```
npm run start
```

The UI is currently hosted on `http://localhost:5173/`, and talks to the local image server on `http://localhost:8901` through your web browser.

## Security warning

The local server on `http://localhost:8901` has the ability to manipulate, move, and remove files on your local disk. It has not been vetted for vulnerabilities, and permitting such behaviour is risky at best - so use this tool at your own risk. Do not keep the server running for longer than neccessary. If the tool at all grows in popularity additional layers of security can be added.
